Articles

French nouns almost always have an article. French has three types of articles:

- Definite articles ("the") are used with specific nouns that are known to the speakers, and also to indicate the general sense of a noun, unlike in English.

- Indefinite articles ("a"/"an"/"one") are used for countable nouns that are unspecified or unknown to the speakers.

- Partitive articles ("some"/"any") indicate a quantity of something uncountable.

Article 		Masculine	Feminine 		Plural 		Exapmle
Definite 		le/l' 		la/l' 			les 		le chat
Indefinite 		un 			une 			des 		une femme
Partitive 		du/de l'	de la/de l'					de l'eau

Articles must agree with their nouns in both gender and number


Elisions

Le and la become just l' if they're followed by a vowel sound. This is an example of elision, which is the removal of a vowel sound in order to prevent consecutive vowel sounds and make pronunciation easier. Elisions are mandatory—for instance, je aime is incorrect. It must be j'aime.

These other one-syllable words can also elide: je, me, te, se, de, ne, and que. Tu can also be elided in casual speech, but not in writing.


Contractions

du is a contraction of the preposition de with le.
	
	du pain — (some) bread

du can create vowel conflicts, when it would appear in front of a vowel sound, it takes the elided de l' form instead. This is also the case for de la.

	de l'ananas [masc.] — (some) pineapple
	de l'eau [fem.] — (some) water
