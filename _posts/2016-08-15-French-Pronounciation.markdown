Pronounciation


Liaisons

In a liaison, an otherwise silent ending consonant is pushed to the next word, where it's pronounced as part of the first syllable. Like elisions, this prevents consecutive vowel sounds. Liaisons are possible whenever a silent ending consonant is followed by a word beginning in a vowel sound, but some liaisons are mandatory and others are forbidden.

Here are some mandatory liaisons, along with approximate pronunciations:

- Articles and adjectives with nouns. For example, un homme ("uh-nohm"), mon orange ("mohn-norahnge"), or deux hommes ("duh-zohm").
- Pronouns and verbs. For example, nous allons ("noo-zalohn") or est-il ("ay-teel").
- Single-syllable adverbs and prepositions. For instance, très utile ("tray-zuteel") or chez elle ("shay-zell").

Liaisons are forbidden:

	- Before and after et ("and").
	- After singular nouns (including proper nouns and names).
	- After inversions ===TODO===
	- Before an aspirated H (e.g. héros - "hero").
	- After a nasal sound, except that un, on, and en do liaise.

Note that some consonants take on a different sound in liaisons to reduce ambiguity.

	Original	Resulting		Example
	Consonant	Liaison Sound	
	-s, -x, -z		Z			des hommes ("day-zohm")
	-d				T			un grand arbre ("uhn-grahn-tarbre")
	-f				V			neuf ans ("nuh-vahn")

When speaking slowly, liaisons are often omitted. 


Enchaînement

In enchaînements, ending consonant sounds are pushed onto the next word if it begins in a vowel. This is essentially the same as a liaison, except that the consonant sound wasn't silent beforehand. For instance:

	elle est is pronounced like "eh-lay".
	mange une pomme is pronounced like "mahn-jun-pom".


The Impersonal Expression Il Y A

Impersonal expressions are phrases where there isn't a real subject. For instance, in the phrase "It is snowing" (Il neige), "it" doesn't refer to anything. It's a dummy subject that exists just to maintain the sentence structure.

One of the most common impersonal expressions is il y a, which is an idiom for "there is" or "there are".

	Il y a une fille ici. — There is a girl here.
	Il y a un serpent dans ma botte ! — There's a snake in my boot!
