Bonjour!

Bonjour is a universal greeting that can be spoken to anyone at any time. In France, greeting people is very important, and some will even say bonjour aloud when entering a public room or bus. Bon après-midi is often used as a farewell in the afternoon, while bonsoir is an evening greeting.

Greetings: bonjour, bonsoir (plus bon matin in Québec only)
Farewells: bonne journée, bon après-midi, bonne soirée, bonne nuit
