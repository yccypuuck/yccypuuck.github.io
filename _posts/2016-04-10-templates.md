I've learned about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from [Yegor's post](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html)

Looks like nice tool for orginizing your thoughts. I'm going to use it for sure! 

It uses plain text to html formatting perl product Markdown. So no html hassle anymore. Check out [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for more info
